INTRODUCTION
Wear Art On Sleeve is a social media oriented to sharing artworks by users.
The works are created by artists of various genres (musicians, singers, painters ...) and the social network facilitates their observation and study.
There are a light theme and a dark theme available.
The site has been designed to be clearly viewable from both mobile devices and computers, but it is designed to be mainly desktop-first.

AUTHORIZATIONS:
- All works, the homepage and the search page are visible even without an account;
- To see the profile page and the form for adding a post you need to log in;
- A user, whether or not they are also an artist, can post a new work, modify their own works or delete them;
- An admin (also called curator) can also delete other people's works.

HOMEPAGE AND SINGLE POST
The homepage shows all the posts published from the most to the least recent, showing the details related to them.
For each post, the following are indicated:
- The username (Name) of the user;
- The time of publication;
- The image of the work, its title, year of realization and a description;
- The data relating to the artist such as the name, the id that identifies him, a brief description and his dates of birth and, possibly, death;
- The relative emoji (also called Emotion) and hashtag (also called Writing because it is its name in the database): it is possible to indicate an emoji and a hashtag to describe the work or how the user feels about it;
- The relative answers to three questions ("What does it make me think of?", "What does it remind me of?" And "What does it make me feel?") Considered as comments on the work.
- If you are logged in, possibly, the update and delete buttons of the work of art. (The upload form has not been implemented yet)

CREATION OF A WORK OF ART (AND THE RESPECTIVE POST)
To create a post and share a work of art you need to have an account, as well as to modify or delete your own works. If you have an administrator account, you can also delete other people's posts.

RESEARCH
The search for a work of art takes place by tag, filling out a form to collect the following data:
- Title of the work (the word entered must be contained in the title of the work, it is not necessary to write the entire title);
- Name of the artist (the word entered must be contained in the name of the work, it is not necessary to write the entire name);
- Emoji;
- Hashtag;

The search returns all the works that have all the characteristics indicated.

MORE TECHNICAL DETAILS
Upon accessing the server, you are directly taken to the home page.
The pages are generated at the moment when you click the corresponding link in the menu bar.

To generate the pages of the social network, various classes are used that extend PageManager.
Other useful classes, always on the client side, are UsefulFunctions, which contains a set of useful functions such as a generalization of fetch or for login/logout, InitRouter to initialize page.js and AddOnClickEvent which adds events to the buttons in the menu bar.

The Database contains test users and posts with which to test the website.
